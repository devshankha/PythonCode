# good example of python class method
# Another way to look at this use of class methods is that they allow you to define alternative constructors for your
# classes. Python only allows one __init__ method per class. Using class methods itâ€™s possible to add as many
# alternative constructors as necessary. This can make the interface for your classes self-documenting
# (to a certain degree) and simplify their usage.
